PURPOSE:

	To collect and analyze trail network data in the UP.

HOW(FEATURES):

	- A place to store and query the data
		- 20 to 25 files of timestamps updated randomly
		- precise time and location
		- online drive?
		- currently have one device that the android app is on
			- walk from node to node with this device to update the data


	- Android Application Support
		- Efficiently send data from mobile to centralized location
		- currently no method of doing this
		
	VISUALIZE DATA
		- Google heat maps 
			1. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/layer-heatmap
			2. Show trail activity by location and time
			3. Label each node
			4. visualze data through filters i.e Monday, Tuesday, Time of Day, etc (give me a map of all tuesdays this month at noon)
		- Python scripts for data analysis using numpy
			1. Plotting a movement path
			2. Graphs of activity over time and location
			3. Calculating speed -- HARD
			4. Determine which timestamps belong to a single individual -- HARD

RESEARCH:
	- Good user experience
